# Image_Rescaling_cv2
This is a project in which we are using cv2 and matplotlib for resizing/rescaling an image 

Rescaling or resampling is the technique used to create a new version of an image with a different size. Increasing the size of the image is called upsampling, and reducing the size of an image is called downsampling.

Here in this project we will be give a dataset of images just try to put the image path and the desired dimensions and you will get the desired output of the image.
