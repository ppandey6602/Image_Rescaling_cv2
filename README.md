# Image_Rescaling_cv2
This is a project in which we are using cv2 and matplotlib for resizing/rescaling an image 

Rescaling or resampling is the technique used to create a new version of an image with a different size. Increasing the size of the image is called upsampling, and reducing the size of an image is called downsampling.

Here in this project we will be give a dataset of images just try to put the image path and the desired dimensions and you will get the desired output of the image.

The images file is attached along side so that we can tryout the code different images.

So here we can see on running the cell the image has been divide into a set of grids which gives us the exact dimensions of the image converting it to the float format.
